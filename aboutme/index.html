            <div id = "aboutme">Hi, I'm Alinando Lennemann. I'm a 15 year old student who goes to Carlmont High School as a freshman. I'm currently taking two classes in the College of San Mateo: Graphic Design and Web Development. I've had a lot of fun making these websites over the past few months. Some other things I enjoy are playing the piano, reading, and drawing. I chose to take a web development course because I find it really interesting how complex the internet is. The constant communication between all these different interconnected systems is really intriguing, and I found myself wanting to know how everything functioned under the hood. While I've just been learning the basics in this class, it is enough for me to appreciate just how much effort and work goes into making everything work.</div>
