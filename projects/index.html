                    <td>This project was one of the projects we did near the beginning of the semester. The main focus of it was to practice using flexbox with CSS, which is a way to make your webpage's layout change and scale based on the size of the user's screen. If you resize your window and change it in this project, you can see how the text collumn becomes narrower to fit it.</td>

                    <td>This HTML project mainly dealt with forms. However, if you input anything into the form itself, it just leads to the default zybooks form submission site.</td>

Javascript was initially a lot more difficult for me to grasp, as it was completely different from CSS or HTML and I had no prior experience with programming languages. This project generates quotes from an external API based on a topic that the user submits.</td>
